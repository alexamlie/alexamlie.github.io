Outside of science, I am also an avid musician. My main instrument is electric bass but I am also an oboist, guitarist, vocalist, drummer, pianist, and mediocre mandolinist. 
Here are some of my projects:

# [Neuroglyph](https://neuroglyph.bandcamp.com)

This is my "one-man band" prog metal project where I compose music drawing on my love of metal, jazz, and classical music, with no limitations. 
Currently I have one album out from 2022 for this project called Pathomachinations.

# [Jasper Lane](https://jasperlane.bandcamp.com)

This is a progressive hard rock band that I play bass with and we are actively gigging in the Boston area. 
My first recording with them is the EP "Becoming the Angel" that came out in 2024.

# [Titan Arum](https://titanarum.bandcamp.com)

This was my first "one-man band" solo project, which I renamed due to another conflicting band. I released one album, Endogenous.
